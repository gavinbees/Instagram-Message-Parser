# Instagram-Message-Parser
This script was designed to organize all of your Instagram messages and look at the data, then format it into a CSV for you to do as you wish whether that's with Excel, Python, or another program. This script was only tested with 1 on 1 chats and was not tested 
with group chats. There are some oddities in the formatting, as any images, videos, audio messages, emojis, and even some grammatical characters like ' or " show up differently. I did not account for this but you can edit the code as you like if you want
to handle it. The data I used to build this project was downloaded from July 2024. If substantial changes have been made since then to the structuring of Instagram chats, this script may not work

## Usage
You must first download and request your data from Meta which will give you access to your messages. Put all of the messages with 1 person in the same file as the .py file
Verify in the .html file that the div id's match what's in the script's code
Adjust the names of the users, your Instagram name is what's above your biography and below your profile picture

## Acknowledgement
I am just a college student messing around with small projects. This was accomplished by reading online tutorials and watching YouTube videos to figure everything out.
I doubt I will come back to this for bug fixes or new features, as the code is pretty understandable and you can do what you want with the program from there
