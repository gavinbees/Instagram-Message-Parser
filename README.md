# Instagram-Message-Parser
This script was designed to organize all of your Instagram messages and look at the data, then format it into a CSV for you to do as you wish whether that's with Excel, Python, or another program. This script was only tested with 1 on 1 chats and was not tested 
with group chats. There are some oddities in the formatting, as any images, videos, audio messages, emojis, and even some grammatical characters like ' or " show up differently. I did not account for this but you can edit the code as you like if you want
to handle it. The data I used to build this project was downloaded from July 2024. If substantial changes have been made since then to the structuring of Instagram chats, this script may not work.

## Usage
You must first download and request your data from Meta which will give you access to your messages. Put all of the message.html files in the same directory as the .py file
Do not have any other .html files in the same directory that your .py and message.html files are in. I have not tested what happens on other .html files but it will likely just cause an error.
Verify in the .html file that the div id's match what's in the script's code
Adjust the names of the users, your Instagram name is what's above your biography and below your profile picture
